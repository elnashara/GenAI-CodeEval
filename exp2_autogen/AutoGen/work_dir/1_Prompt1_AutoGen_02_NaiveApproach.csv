- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a function that finds the median (middle value) of a list of numbers and then calculates the average of all values greater than or equal to the median.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Determine if a directed graph contains a cycle using depth-first search.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process

- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Find the last occurrence of a target element in a sorted array using binary search.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Implement an iterative version of the binary search algorithm to find the index of an element in a sorted array.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

50,3,hard,Depth-First Search (DFS),Determining if a directed graph contains a cycle using DFS.,"## Problem Statement
- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Determining if a directed graph contains a cycle using DFS.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python
