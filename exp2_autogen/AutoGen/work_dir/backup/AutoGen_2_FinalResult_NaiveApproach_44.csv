- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a function that finds the median (middle value) of a list of numbers and then calculates the average of all values greater than or equal to the median.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to calculate the average of a list of numbers using a for loop.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Write a program to reverse a given string without using any built-in functions.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Design a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Develop an algorithm to reverse only the vowels in a given string, while keeping consonants in their original positions.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Implement a function that reverses every other word in a sentence, starting from the second word.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Create code to reverse each individual word in a sentence, while preserving whitespace and punctuation.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

- Develop a Python script to solve the problem: 'Create a program that counts the occurrences of each unique word in a paragraph.'

## Solution Development
- Create a Python function named 'funcImp' that implements the solution.
- Ensure that the function is defined at the beginning of your script and is accessible throughout the script.

## Script Requirements
- The script should define the 'funcImp' function at the root level, not inside any class or other function.
- Include comments in the script to explain the logic and functionality of the 'funcImp' function.
- Test the function within the script to ensure it's correctly defined and functioning as expected.

## Test Case Execution
- Execute the 'funcImp' function with various test cases to verify its correctness.
- Ensure that the function 'funcImp' is defined and accessible in the scope where the test cases are executed.

## Test Case Preparation
- Prepare a set of test cases, including edge cases, to thoroughly test the function.
- Test cases should cover different types of input strings, such as alphabetic, numeric, special characters, and empty strings.

## Execution Process
- Run each test case through the 'funcImp' function.
- Capture the output of each test case to compare it with the expected result.","```python
