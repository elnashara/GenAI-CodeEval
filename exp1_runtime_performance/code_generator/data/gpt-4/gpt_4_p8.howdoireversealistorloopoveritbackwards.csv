Problem Description:

The task is to reverse a list of integers in Python or iterate over it in reverse order. The complexity or simplicity of the final code solution is totally up to the coder, though a higher preference would be given to the most efficient solution.

The Python code should be encapsulated in a function. The function should be named ""funcImp"". The function should take only one parameter:

The function's name should be `funcImp`. This function should take a single argument, `arg1`, which is a list of integers. The purpose of this function is twofold: one, to reverse the order of the elements in the list `arg1`; and two, to iterate over the list in a reverse manner.

The function's name should be `funcImp`. This function should take a single argument, `arg1`, which is a list of integers. The purpose of this function is twofold: one, to reverse the order of the elements in the list `arg1`; and two, to iterate over the list in a reverse manner.

Please note that your solution should only define the function signature and not implement the function body.

Here is how the function signature should look:
```python
def funcImp(arg1: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    pass
```
In this problem, no test cases are required as there is no function body to test. 

Notes: The `List` type hint requires an import from the `typing` module. Be sure to include `from typing import List` at the beginning of your code. It is a common practice to use type hints in the function declaration to indicate the data type of the argument and the return type of the function. Although they do not enforce a type like in compiled languages, they provide useful information to other developers read or use your function.

Description:
This coding problem focuses on dealing with a list of integers in Python. The task is to create a function capable of reversing the list or iteratively accessing the elements of the list in a backward manner. For achieving this goal, the function implementation should be encapsulated in a function named ""funcImp"".

The function ""funcImp"" will accept one parameter:

The function does not have any return statement specific in the problem description. Depending on the specific task (i.e., reversing the list itself or just looping through it in reverse order), a return type may be needed. More details are needed for exact function's requirement.

Note: Python provides built-in ways to reverse a list or iterate over it in reverse for us to explore. Implementations may differ based on whether the input list ""arg1"" can be modified or not.

The function's Python signature should look like this (implementation not included):

The function ""funcImp"" will accept one parameter: 

- arg1 (List[int]): a list of integers that will be operated on. This list may contain any number of integers, and it can be empty.

The function does not have any return statement specific in the problem description. Depending on the specific task (i.e., reversing the list itself or just looping through it in reverse order), a return type may be needed. More details are needed for exact function's requirement.

Note: Python provides built-in ways to reverse a list or iterate over it in reverse for us to explore. Implementations may differ based on whether the input list ""arg1"" can be modified or not.

The function's Python signature should look like this (implementation not included):

```python
from typing import List

def funcImp(arg1: List[int]) -> None: # Return type might change depending on requirements
    pass  # TODO: Implement the function
```

Problem Description:
You are given a list of integers, you need to perform two operations on the list: reverse the list and iterate over it backwards. 

Your task is to write a python function called ""funcImp(arg1)"". This function should execute the following tasks:
1. Reverse the list of integers
2. Loop over the reversed list. 

Input:
- The function ""funcImp(arg1)"" takes a single parameter; a list of integers 'arg1'. The length of the list 'arg1' (1<= len(arg1) <= 10^5) where each integer 'a' (1<= a <= 10^9) corresponds to the integer value in the 'arg1'.

Output:
- The function should reverse the list 'arg1' and then iterate over the reversed list.

You don't need to return anything from the function. 

Example: 

If the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the function should first reverse the list, resulting in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Then loop over this reversed list. 

Note: No specific action is mentioned to be performed during the loop over the reversed list, so you are free to decide how the loop should be processed (like print each element one by one, etc.).

Description:
For this challenge, you are required to write a Python function which will either reverse a list or iterate over it backwards. The function must be constructed in an efficient manner ensuring swift operation. 

The core functionalities expected in the function are:
1. Accepting a single list of integers as an input.
2. Reversing the given list of integers or iterating over it backwards. 

You are to work with the following method signature:

```python
def funcImp(arg1: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

Where:
- The function `funcImp` takes in arg1, a list of integers, as its argument.
- The function `funcImp` returns the reversed list or a list produced by iterating over `arg1` backwards.

The implementation of the function should be quick and the memory footprint should ideally be minimized.

                            Title: Reverse a List or Iterate Over it Backwards in Python 

Description:
For this challenge, you are required to write a Python function which will either reverse a list or iterate over it backwards. The function must be constructed in an efficient manner ensuring swift operation. 

The core functionalities expected in the function are:
1. Accepting a single list of integers as an input.
2. Reversing the given list of integers or iterating over it backwards. 

You are to work with the following method signature:

```python
def funcImp(arg1: List[int]) -> List[int]:
```

Where:
- The function `funcImp` takes in arg1, a list of integers, as its argument.
- The function `funcImp` returns the reversed list or a list produced by iterating over `arg1` backwards.

The implementation of the function should be quick and the memory footprint should ideally be minimized. 

Note: The implementation of the function is not provided, you are expected to provide that in a competent manner within the constraints of the problem's requirements.

1. To reverse the entire list of integers.
2. To iterate over the list of integers in a reverse order (backwards).

Problem Description:

You are required to create a function in Python that is capable of reversing a given list of integers or iterating over this list in a reversed order. The primary objective while crafting this solution is that the function should have a fast implementation.

Method Signature:
We have named this Python function as ""funcImp"". This function will accept one parameter as follows:

1. ""arg1"": This is a list of integers which needs to be reversed or to be iterated over in a reversed way.

So the function signature will look like: `def funcImp(arg1: List[int]) -> List[int]:`

Problem Description:

You are required to create a function in Python that is capable of reversing a given list of integers or iterating over this list in a reversed order. The primary objective while crafting this solution is that the function should have a fast implementation.

Method Signature:
We have named this Python function as ""funcImp"". This function will accept one parameter as follows:

The goal is specifically to flip the order of the elements in the list passed as the argument or go through the elements in the list in a reverse sequence.
